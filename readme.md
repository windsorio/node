</div>

## Get started

1. **Create a [Windsor](https://windsor.io) Account** and grab your token
2. **Create Users** on Windsor
   - With `windsor-node`, call `windsor.user(...)` everytime a new user signs up or data about a user changes to keep things updated
3. **Track Events**
   - You'll want to see every important event or issue your user runs into. Call `windsor.event(...)` for every event you want to know a user has taken. You can setup alerts and more from [Windsor](https://windsor.io)

### Why?

You care about your users. You probably already have a slack channel filling up with important events, or you search through logs to see what your users are upto. Windsor is a better way so you can be deliberate about the events you track and so your company can more easily manage and follow up with your users.

For example, you can create users on any app:

```js
windsor.user({
  userId: "01nc83ns",
  traits: {
    name: "Pranay Prakash",
    email: "hey@windsor.io",
    company: "windsor",
    posts: 42
  }
});
```

And track events you'd like to know your users took

```js
windsor.event({
  userId: "01nc83ns",
  event: "Post Created",
  properties: {
    title: "Getting Started",
    private: false
  }
});
```

Then follow the user on [Windsor](https://windsor.io)

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install windsor-node
```

## Usage

```js
const Windsor = require("windsor-node");

const windsor = new Windsor("token");

windsor.user({
  userId: "user id",
  traits: {
    name: "user name",
    email: "user email"
  }
});

windsor.event({
  event: "event name",
  userId: "user id"
});
```
